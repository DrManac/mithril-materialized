## Version history

v0.9.7 No breaking changes

- `ModalPanel`: it's description (i.e. the main content area of the modal) can be a `Vnode`.
- `Select` does not use `contentClass` anymore, but instead uses the regular mithril `className` (but not `class`, since this is a reserved keyword in TypeScript).

v0.9.6 No breaking changes

- For a `Collection` with secondary content, do not create a SPA route (with a #!) but leave the URL as is.

v0.9.5 No breaking changes

- FIX `Select` bug when numeric option IDs were used and ID === 0, option was never selected.

v0.9.4 No breaking changes

- FIX `Collection` without headers did no longer render.

v0.9.3 No breaking changes

- `Collection` with links can now also contain a header.
- `Collection` with no items and only a header will now just render the header

v0.9.0 Breaking changes

- `Collapsible` is now correctly spelled (used to be `Collabsible`, oops).
- Added `Collection`, to create a collection of items: supports basic, link and avatar collections.

v0.8.3 No breaking changes

- `FileInput` component can be disabled, and accepts file types.

v0.8.1 No breaking changes

- Closes issue #1: Select issue with id === 0
- MaterialBox can set height, passes attributes to wrapped image element

v0.8.0 No breaking changes

- `FileInput` component can specify `class` property on the `div` wrapper (default `col s12`) and `contentClass` property on the file input element.

v0.7.0 Breaking changes for Dropdown component.

- New `FileInput` component to upload one or more files.
- `Dropdown` uses similar items as `Select`, and uses `checkedId` to select the item.
- `Dropdown` items can now use an icon and dividers.
- `Dropdown` can now have a helper text option and an icon prefix.

v0.6.4 Breaking changes, bug fix.

- `Select` did not always return the proper id on selection changes with multiple elements.

v0.6.3 No breaking changes, bug fix.

- `Select` did not update dynamically when checkedId changed.

v0.6.2 No breaking changes

- `Select` can use `M.FormSelectOptions`.

v0.6.1 No breaking changes

- `Select` can have `disabled` options, and `id` is optional (in which case the label is used).
- `Select` can use a prefix icon.

v0.6.0 No breaking changes

- `Inputs` can now use `onkeyup`, `onkeydown`, and `onkeypress` events. They also return the value.
- Additionally, they can use `readOnly`, `pattern` and `autocomplete` (does not always seem to work).

v0.5.0 No breaking changes

- NEW: Pagination control
- BUG FIX: `Input.onchange` would not fire if the input was cleared.
- All options now derives from mithril's `Attributes`.
- Using `FactoryComponent` type

v0.4.4 No breaking changes

- Do not pass attributes through, e.g. if you had a `m(FlatButton, { onupdate })`, the `onupdate` was passed through to the `HelperText` too.

v0.4.3 No breaking changes

- The validate method for inputs now also accepts the HTMLInputElement
- Removed a few left-over `console.log` statements.

v0.4.2 No breaking changes

- Added `required` and `aria-required="true"` attributes when the `required` or `isMandatory` property are set.

v0.4.1 No breaking changes

- Updated all components to use the mithril `dom` attribute instead of performing a document query. This has two advantages: first of all, performance, since we do not need to query for an element we already have. Second, when implementing custom elements that have an `oncreate` function. Using document.query... will lead to no results.

v0.4.0 No breaking changes

- New components: MaterialBox, Collapsible or accordion, and Carousel

v0.3.0 Breaking changes

- Buttons no longer use the `ui` class to specify additional properties like `onclick`. Instead, you can leverage the mithril attributes directly. See the example, `button-page`.
- `contentClass` has been removed in favour of the default mithril `class` or `className` attribute.
- The Icon function has been replaced by the `Icon` component. The `SmallIcon` and `PrefixedIcon` have been removed, as they can easily be created using the `Icon` component.
- The `autofocus` attribute for inputs now also works on updates (by calling the element.focus() method).
- The code has been split over multiple files, so it is easier to only import the components that you need.

v0.2.2

- Validate function can return a custom validation message. Also, it is called in `onupdate`, so the validation occurs also when you just attach the validate function conditionally.

v0.2.1

- Label field is optional for inputs.
- Added autofocus function|property to input fields.
- Added custom validation using the validate function|property to add valid/invalid label to an input.
- Removed dependency on materialize-css (it is expected that it is imported via the main app).

## Usage instructions

See the [documentation](https://erikvullings.github.io/mithril-materialized/index.html) for examples on how to use this library in your own application. Please note that the library does not include mithril, nor the materialize-css JavaScript or CSS, so you have to include them yourself, as documented.

## Build instructions

This repository consists of two packages, combined using `lerna`: the `lib` package that is published to `npm`, as well as an `example` project which uses this library to display the Mithril components that it contains.

To install the dependencies, you can use `npm i`, or, alternatively, use `pnpm m i` (assuming you have installed `pnpm` as alternative package manager using `npm i -g pnpm`) to perform a multi-repository install. Next, build everything using `npm start` and visit the documentation page on [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) in case port 1234 is not occupied already.

## CSS

Although I've tried to limit the CSS adaptations to a minimum, I needed to tweak certain parts to make it look better. Here are the styles I've added.

```css
.clear,
.clear-10,
.clear-15 {
  clear: both;
  /* overflow: hidden; PrÃ©caution pour IE 7 */
}
.clear-10 {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}
.clear-15 {
  margin-bottom: 15px;
}

input[type='color']:not(.browser-default) {
  margin: 0px 0 8px 0;
  /** Copied from input[type=number] */
  background-color: transparent;
  border: none;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #9e9e9e;
  border-radius: 0;
  outline: none;
  height: 3rem;
  width: 100%;
  font-size: 16px;
  padding: 0;
  -webkit-box-shadow: none;
  box-shadow: none;
  -webkit-box-sizing: content-box;
  box-sizing: content-box;
  -webkit-transition: border 0.3s, -webkit-box-shadow 0.3s;
  transition: border 0.3s, -webkit-box-shadow 0.3s;
  transition: box-shadow 0.3s, border 0.3s;
  transition: box-shadow 0.3s, border 0.3s, -webkit-box-shadow 0.3s;
}

.codeblock {
  margin: 1.5rem 0 2.5rem 0;
}
.codeblock > div {
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

.codeblock > label {
  display: inline-block;
}

span.mandatory {
  margin-left: 5px;
  color: red;
}

label+.switch {
  margin-top: 1rem;
}
```
